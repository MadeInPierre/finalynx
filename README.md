You can check the [current development status](https://github.com/users/MadeInPierre/projects/4). Contributions are warmly welcome!

## üöÄ Installation
If you don't plan on touching the code, simply run (with python >=3.8 and pip installed):
```sh
pip install finalynx  # run again with --upgrade to update
```

And you're done! Now create your own copy of the [`demo.py`](https://github.com/MadeInPierre/finalynx/blob/main/examples/demo.py) example anywhere and run it to make sure everything works. You can now customize it for your own needs üöÄ

**Pro Tip üí°:** _Why not setup a script to autorun your config in a new terminal on startup? Could be a nice view_ ü§≠

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage & Documentation
The goal is to declare a tree structure of your entire portfolio independently from their host envelopes (e.g. PEA, AV, CTO, etc). Once your entire portfolio strategy is defined here, find the best envelope for each line and add them to your Finary account (manual or automatic sync). Finalynx will fetch each line and display your full portfolio with real-time amounts.

Here is the bare minimum code accepted:

```python
from finalynx import Portfolio, Assistant
portfolio = Portfolio()  # <- your custom configuration here
Assistant(Portfolio()).run()
```

You can now populate the `Portfolio` class with your own custom hierarchy by taking inspiration from the [`demo.py`](https://github.com/MadeInPierre/finalynx/blob/main/examples/demo.py) example or by reading the [Getting Started](https://finalynx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/getting_started.html) guide in the documentation. For additional details, checkout the full [API Reference](https://finalynx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidocs/index.html).
