```{tip}
This subpackage has a [dedicated milestone](https://github.com/MadeInPierre/finalynx/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open) in the development steps.
```

Finalynx Analyzer: generate all kinds of statistics and visualization graphs for your portfolio.

This subpackage provides "attachments" that you can add to any node in your Portfolio tree.
Each attachement provides a different graph, such as:
- Asset class allocation for the selected folder
- A fund availability allocation (e.g. lines in a PER are unavailable until an event "retirement"
or "buy house" is triggered, lines in a PEA are blocked for 5 years, AV will have a highly taxed
state instead of blocked, ...). This graph would show how much money would be available when.
- And many more, please share your ideas in the [Discussions](https://github.com/MadeInPierre/finalynx/discussions) space :)

This subpackage has not started development yet, check back later or help us build it by contributing!
