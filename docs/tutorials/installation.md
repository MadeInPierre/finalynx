# 🔧 Installation

If you don't plan on touching the code, simply run (with python >=3.8 and pip installed):
```sh
pip install finalynx  # run again with --upgrade to update
```

And you're done! Now create your own copy of the [`demo.py`](https://github.com/MadeInPierre/finalynx/blob/main/examples/demo.py) example anywhere and run it to make sure everything works. You can now customize it for your own needs 🚀

```{tip}
**Pro Tip 💡:** Why not setup a script to autorun your config in a new terminal on startup? Could be a nice view 🤭
